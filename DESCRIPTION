Description: From uploaded data visualise the interactive sunburst diagram and following interactive detailed plots. 
      1) Detailed timely individual trajectories clustered by similarity
      2) Show lengths of each state aligned from start or select a new state to align by
      3) Observe distance between 2 selected states (time before or after selected sequence alignment point)
      4) Download generated plots and funnel visualisation
      5) Analyse detailed data tables generated from the source file
